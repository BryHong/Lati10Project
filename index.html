                <p>On October 18, 2019, Santiago's streets erupted in chaos. Beginning as a student-led protest against a metro fare increase (Borzutzky & Perry, 2021), the protests grew in size to become one of the largest social uprising in Chile. The chant "It's not 30 pesos, it's 30 years" (Waissbluth, 2020, p. 30) echoed through the capital, revealing a discontent that existed beyond public transportation costs.</p>
                <p>To understand why a 30-peso (about 1.5 USD) hike caused such a big unrest, we need to explore how the 2019 Chilean protests reveal deep-rooted inequalities and offer crucial insights into contemporary Latin American issues.</p>

                <h2 class="display-4">Two Sides of Chile's Economic Growth</h2>
                <p>For decades, Chile has been viewed as Latin America's economic miracle. Following the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990), the country followed free-market policies and their economics seemed to be improving, at least on paper by GDP per capita and other metrics. International organizations frequently cited Chile as a model for development that other countries should follow, even being called an Economic miracle by economist Milton Friedman.</p>
                <img src="media/img/image3.png" alt="Image2">
                <p>However, while it is true that Chile's economy did grow, its inequality remains high. The benefits of this growth were concentrated only among a small elite, while many Chileans struggled with low wages, inadequate pensions, and limited access to quality education and healthcare. First hand accounts from the protestors themselves display the dissatisfied sentiment clearly.</p>

                <p>To get a bigger picture of the existing income disparity, we can view Chile’s Gini coefficients. Historically, while Chile’s Gini value is not as high as some other countries, the data graphs provided by the World Bank show a small spike in Gini index value around the time of the protests, showing the potential event of a spike in wealth disparity around 2020.</p>

                <p>To truly understand the 2019 protests, we need to look beyond economic indicators. This is where insights from Latin American Studies helps us understand the social and historical aspect of the protests. The concepts discussed by a cultural theorist Stuart Hall and Peruvian sociologist Anibal Quijano offer a new viewpoint through which we can analyze Chile's situation.</p>

                <div class="adjacent-images">
                    <img src="media/img/image4.png" alt="Image 4" class="adjacent-image">

                  </div>
                <p>Stuart Hall's work helps us get a better understanding of the inner workings of the Chilean protest. In his essay "The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power," Hall examines how Western societies have historically represented and understood non-Western cultures as inferior, and describes this to be creating a powerful discourse. As a foundation for his argument, Hall's concept of discourse is introduced by stating that discourse is "a way of talking… [that] produces knowledge that shapes perceptions and practice. It is part of the way in which power operates" (Hall, 1996, p. 201). This idea of discourse helps us view Chile's history and connect the past and current situations.</p>
                <p>This leads to Hall's main argument that the discourse of "the West and the Rest" has created a contrast between Western and non-Western societies, often portraying the latter as less developed or civilized. He states, "The West produced many different ways of talking about itself and 'the Others.' But what we have called the discourse of 'the West and the Rest' became one of the most powerful and formative of these discourses" (Hall, 1996, p. 225).</p>
                <p>Applying Hall's concept to Chile's situation, we can see how this discourse has influenced both internal and outer perceptions of the country. On the outside, Chile might have been thought of as Latin America's economic miracle reasoned with the country’s adoption of neoliberal policies and steady economic growth. Even Milton Friedman, a prominent American economist, uses the term “Miracle of Chile” to describe the success in Chile’s economy in an interview clip (LivertyPenn., 0:59 - 1:40) discussing of Chilean economics students from the University of Chicago called the “Chicago Boys”, who developed an entire plan for capitalist reforms in Chile. He remarked how it was a “miracle in Chile” that the military government at that time under Pinochet was willing to let these students revise their economy entirely from the ground up without any confrontation, which allowed significant US-sided democratic reforms (LibertyPenn, 2013). This narrative aligns with the Western ideal of development and progress. However, as the 2019 protests revealed, this outer discourse blocked the outside world from being able to view the deep-seated inequalities known only to the people of Chile.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>“People got tired of the bad distribution of the wealth, the natural reCitations, money, and everything that exists in the country. It's not about taking the rich's things so we can get everything for free. It's about making justice.” </p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Another point of view on the root cause for this uprising can be found through examining Quijano's "Coloniality of Power". In the text, Quijano argues that even after the end of formal colonialism, colonial power structures continue to exist in modern societies. These structures maintain underlying hierarchies based on race, class, and gender, shaping how reCitations and opportunities are distributed.</p>
                <p>This helps explain the unbalanced distribution of wealth in Chile's economy despite the GDP continuously growing and guides us to a fundamental reason for economic inequalities inside Chile. From this analysis, we can see that the neoliberal model didn't directly create economic disparities. Rather, it reinforced existing social hierarchies from the colonial past that in turn led to economic disparities.</p>

                <p>The 2019 Chilean protests serve as a powerful case study to understand the real workings of modern Latin American societies and how interconnected the economy, society, and historical events really are. By applying the theoretical frameworks of Stuart Hall and Anibal Quijano, we gain crucial insights that go beyond surface-level economic analyses.</p>
                <p>Hall's concept of discourse helps us understand how Chile's image as an economic "miracle" on the outside was very different from its internal realities. The countries creating the outer discourse were distant from Chile’s realities and therefore were unable to properly notice the deep-seated inequalities that were ultimately revealed through the Chilean protests. The uprising can be seen as a moment when the dominant discourse was finally shaken up, bringing to light the reality of the "other Chile" that had been overshadowed by surface level economic statistics.</p>
                <p>Quijano's "Coloniality of Power" also provides a very important historical context that reveals that Chile's economic disparities are not simply the result of recent neoliberal policies. Rather, the inequalities in Chile resulted from power structures that stemmed from the colonial era. This perspective helps explain why economic growth alone was insufficient to create true economic prosperity.</p>
                <p>Overall, the story of Chile's awakening through the protest shows us that progress can’t always be straightforward enough to be explained with just the charts and graphs. While analyzing the data is certainly important, it is also important to notice that there is more nuance to be considered especially when exploring what it means for a country, and not a few individuals, to experience true economic growth. This event helps us take a step back from the charts to show us both the truth through the Chilean’s insider view, and in the end, demonstrating the power of collective action to create real change. In the end, it's clear that societal advancement is just a by-product of constant work that is put in to address underlying inequalities and injustices.</p>
